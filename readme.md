# Something about the OpenHA

The OpenHA (Open Health Assessment) is an easy-to-use and open health assessment framework consisting of various tools and methods.
The framework is designed to make it easier and quicker for users to build and implement their own health assessment applications.

This project is initially launched by the Reliable Flight Control Group (rfly) of Beihang University, and the tentative idea of OpenHA could trace back to the year 2019, just before the breakout of the COVID-19 epidemic.

In the past years, we have done a lot of work to get us prepared to launch this long-term project.

We have done some relative projects, conducted in-depth research, and published some scientific papers.

In a word, our team is growing all the time.

Itâ€™s time now.

This project is being developed right now and itâ€™s expected to be officially released before July.

Please contact us if you are also interested in it and would like to join us to make your contributions.

Documents are available in [this repository](https://rfly-openha.github.io/documents/) (not finished yet ðŸ˜‚).

More information about rfly is available on our [official website](http://rfly.buaa.edu.cn/).
